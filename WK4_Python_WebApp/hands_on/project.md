You are given a project https://github.com/JiangRenDevOps/EasyCRM and the project owner would like you to help him 
setup more meaningful endpoints, git branches, tests, CI/CD, monitoring and many more.

Let us 
* break down into small groups (3-6 people per group)
* have a Jira kanban board setup for the team
* track each point with epic, discuss and breakdown the epic into tasks
* get them assigned and people work on it
* apply the hands-on knowledge to the tasks
